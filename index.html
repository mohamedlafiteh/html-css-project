                            <li> Many people think that strength training is bad for your agility
                            ,<br>
                            but is <em>this really true?</li></em> <li>Well, that depends on how you train. <br>
                            Some studies found that certain strength exercises
                            and training methods<br> have a positive influence on your agility.</li>
                            <li>In order to keep your agility it is important to perform exercises <br>
                            with a full range ofmotion.</li> Below we explain more about this.</p></ol>

                          <ul>
                            <li>Muscles can pull by shortening the muscle fibers.</li>
                          <li>Agility is more or less the opposite. It’s the ability to stretch <br>
                         your muscle fibers and make them as long and thin as possible.</li>
                         <li> Right after a workout your muscles are a little swollen <br>
                         due to increased blood flows and body acids. </li><li>This will make it harder<br>
                         for your muscle fibers to become stretched and thin,<br>
                         and therefore you are a little less agile right after a strength workout. </li>
                         <li>Although this is just a temporary effect.</li></p>

                 <h1 class="fond2">*WHEN YOU CONSTANTLY PERFORM EXERCISES WITHOUT A FULL RANGE OF MOTION</h1><br>
                <ul>
                 <li>then this could have a long term negative effect on your agility. </li>
                   <li>A full range of motion means that you fully bend and stretch<br>
                  you joints and muscles during an exercise.</li> <li>In that way 
                  you keep your muscle fibers long and thin.</li>
                   <li>When you only do exercises with a short range of motion,<br>
                   then after a while your muscles become shorter.</li> <li>Your muscles will
                   learn very well how to pull themselves together,<br>
                   but they will not get used to become long and thin. </li>
                   <li>So in order to keep your agility it is important to perform<br>
                    exercises with a full range of motion!</li>
                  <li> Research even showed that strength training can 
                   <br>increase your agility as long as you perform <br>
                  a full range of motion.</li>
