          <p>Many people think that strength training is bad for your agility,<br>
            but is <em>this really true?</em> Well, that depends on how you train. <br>
            Some studies found that certain strength exercises<br>
             and training methods have a positive influence on your agility.<br>
             In order to keep your agility it is important to perform exercises <br>
            with a full range ofmotion. Below we explain more about this.</p>

       <p>Your muscles are actually made of large quantities of muscle fibers. <br>
        Muscles can pull by shortening the muscle fibers.<br>
         Agility is more or less the opposite. It’s the ability to stretch <br>
         your muscle fibers and make them as long and thin as possible.<br>
         Right after a workout your muscles are a little swollen <br>
         due to increased blood flows and body acids. This will make it harder<br>
          for your muscle fibers to become stretched and thin,<br>
           and therefore you are a little less agile right after a strength workout. <br>
           Although this is just a temporary effect.</p>

<p>When you constantly perform exercises without a full range of motion,<br>
  then this could have a long term negative effect on your agility. <br>
  A full range of motion means that you fully bend and stretch<br>
   you joints and muscles during an exercise. In that way <br>
   you keep your muscle fibers long and thin.
    When you only do exercises with a short range of motion,<br>
     then after a while your muscles become shorter. Your muscles will<br>
      learn very well how to pull themselves together,<br>
       but they will not get used to become long and thin. <br>
       So in order to keep your agility it is important to perform<br>
        exercises with a full range of motion!
    Research even showed that strength training can 
    <br>increase your agility as long as you perform <br>
    a full range of motion.</p>
